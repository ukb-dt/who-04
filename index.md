# **THE WHO-INDIA PENTADIC SURFACE**

A single [landing page](https://ukb-dt.github.io/who-04-landing-page/) that reads like a calm explanation, not an instruction manual.

### **AI is an infrastructure.**

Just like roads, electricity, and water—AI helps us *move*, *power*, and *connect* medical evidence.

Under the hood, all AI systems—no matter the brand—work through **five layers**.

Officers only need to know the surface definitions.
Those who want depth can click through the hyperlinks you already created.

Here is the **public-health-friendly pentadic stack**, mapped to your vocabulary.

---

# **1. Physics → “The World of Information”**

**What exists before AI touches it.**
Public health data, journal articles, case reports, Hindi/Tamil documents, grey literature, field notes.

This is the *reality*. AI cannot improve it—only reveal it.

→ officers click through to **Background** and **Literature** pages
→ deep users reach “World/LLM” and your ontology notes

---

# **2. Engineering → “How AI Finds It”**

**How information is located and organized.**
This is Perception AI: search, discovery, extraction.

• finding the paper       
• reading the PDF         
• recognizing language        
• indexing grey literature                    
• extracting numbers, outcomes, sample sizes           

It's not magic—just engineering.

→ officers click **Methods: Perception AI**                     
→ deeper users reach your Perception/API and multimodal stack        

---

# **3. Grammar → “How AI Structures It”**

**How information is arranged into flows.**
This is where AI turns raw text into evidence:

• PICO extraction       
• PRISMA screening          
• Definitions of outcomes         
• Listing study characteristics       
• Summaries of inclusion/exclusion        

It’s called Grammar because it shapes the *flow* of evidence, like a sentence.

→ officers click **Tailored Workflow**                              
→ deeper users reach your “Agentic” layer and workflow automation       

---

# **4. Prosody → “How AI Disciplines It”**

**How evidence becomes trustworthy.**
Prosody in language is the cadence and emphasis; in public health it is:

• Bias detection        
• Risk of bias reporting       
• Confidence grading       
• Sensitivity checks          
• Point vs Interval estimates       

This is the disciplined layer—where rigor enters the room.

→ officers click **Limitations: Invariant Aspects**           
→ deeper users reach “Embodied AI audits” and alignment pages       

---

# **5. Metaphysics → “How Humans Understand It”**

**How humans ask questions, interpret findings, and make decisions.**
This is your epistemology.
The layer where AI stops and public health begins.

• Co-adaptation        
• Judgment        
• Ethics           
• Policy drafting            
• Contextual interpretation       
• Cultural relevance              
• Indian soil → Indian solutions      

This is also where *WHO-India shapes AI*, not the other way around.

→ officers click **Conclusions: Vocabulary Beyond AI Tools**
→ deeper users reach your epistemic stack, governance notes, and co-adaptation work

# **WHY THIS SURFACE WORKS FOR WHO-INDIA**

### **It speaks *plainly*.**

No algorithms. No “LLMs.” No “CLIPs.” No jargon.

### **It respects their time.**

Officers don’t want a course in AI architecture.
They want a mental model for “How does this help me do my job?”

### **It hides the machinery but keeps it available.**

Anyone can descend into:

• your AI-stack         
• your GitHub pages      
• your GPU explanation        
• your Perception AI        
• your equity framework       
• your evidence pipeline             

But only if they want to.

### **It aligns directly with WHO priorities.**

Bias → Equity        
Gaps → Action      
Evidence → Access       
Policy → Speed         
Languages → Inclusion              
Databases → PRISMA compliance             
Officers → Capacity-building at scale        

### **It creates co-adaptation, not replacement.**

This is the emotional key:
AI doesn’t replace the officer—they *co-learn* and *co-work*.

# **Would you like me to turn this pentadic surface into a full WHO-India landing page?**

I can generate:

• the writing        
• the structure      
• the typography      
• the hyperlinks         
• the navigation model        
• the embedded metaphors        
• the tone (WHO-appropriate)        
• the collapsible-depth sections            

Just say the word, and I’ll build it in your existing GitHub-pages format.
